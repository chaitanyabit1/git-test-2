<h3>How to design your own data lake framework in AWS</h3>
A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed for analytics applications. Unlike traditional data warehouses, which store data in a structured and preprocessed manner, data lakes store data in its original form, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in data management and usage.

Today in this blog we will talk about data lakes and how you can design your own data lake framework in AWS. 
  
But, before starting with the “HOW TO” process - lets understand why we need data lakes and the story behind it and how AWS appeared as a solution in designing a data lake framework.

<div class="content-box">
  <p>The origins of data lakes can be traced back to the emergence of Hadoop, the open-source software framework designed for distributed storage and processing of big data. In its early days, Hadoop was seen as a solution for handling the rapidly growing volumes of semi-structured and unstructured data that traditional databases struggled to manage efficiently.</p>

  <p>The initial hype surrounding Hadoop led to the misconception that organizations could simply dump vast amounts of raw data into a centralized repository, known as a data lake, and allow users to freely explore and analyze this data. However, multiple high-profile failures soon revealed the flaws in this approach, as these early data lakes quickly descended into disorganized and poorly governed data swamps, plagued by issues such as:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: auto;
  list-style-position: inside;
  margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li>Data redundancy, which skewed analytical results and introduced inconsistencies.</li>
    <li>Lack of auditability and traceability, eroding trust in the data.</li>
    <li>Poor query performance, undermining the primary purpose of data lakes – enabling high-performance exploration and discovery.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These undocumented and disorganized early data lakes become nearly impossible to navigate, hindering their usefulness for enterprise applications. To address these challenges, metadata tagging emerged as a crucial practice for managing data lakes, making it easier to locate and understand the data stored within them.</p>
  <p>Over time, the technologies and methodologies used to implement data lakes have evolved, moving beyond the initial focus on Hadoop to incorporate a broader range of traditional and big data technologies. </p>

  <h3>What is the importance of data lakes?</h3>
  
  <div class="content-box">
    Data lakes are crucial for modern businesses due to their ability to rapidly ingest diverse types of new data, providing self-service access, exploration, and visualization. This capability allows businesses to swiftly respond to new information and access data that was previously unattainable. 

    These new data types and sources facilitate data discovery, proofs of concept, visualizations, and advanced analytics. For instance, a data lake on AWS is the primary data source for machine learning applications, which often utilize log files, clickstream data from websites, social media content, streaming sensor data, and information from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

    Many businesses have long desired the ability to perform discovery-oriented exploration, advanced analytics, and reporting. An AWS data lake provides the necessary scale and diversity of data, enabling these capabilities. Additionally, it serves as a consolidation point for both big data and traditional data, allowing for comprehensive analytical correlations across all data sets.

    While typically used to store raw data, a data lake in AWS can also house intermediate or fully transformed, restructured, or aggregated data produced by data warehouses and downstream processes. This approach, often part of a data lake house architecture, significantly reduces the time data scientists spend on common data preparation tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

    AWS analytics services support this by providing a robust data platform architecture and streamlined data pipeline processes, making AWS data services an integral part of a modern data strategy. By leveraging the AWS data analytics ecosystem, businesses can build an efficient data lakehouse, ensuring scalable and flexible data management and analytics solutions.
